    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">1. Vertical Gardening</h2>
    <p>Transform dull walls and fences into vibrant vertical gardens using a mix of hanging baskets, tiered shelves, or mounted planters. This method is perfect for maximizing limited space in urban Nepali homes. Incorporating vines, herbs, and flowering plants not only adds visual appeal but also helps purify the air and insulate walls, creating a cooler, greener atmosphere.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">2. Balcony Planters</h2>
    <p>Convert your balcony into a serene green retreat by adding rail-mounted planters, corner stands, and cascading pots. Add a mix of ornamental and edible plants to create a functional and calming space. With thoughtful placement and seasonal selections, balconies can become tiny ecosystems buzzing with butterflies, bees, and fresh fragrances.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">3. Raised Bed Gardening</h2>
    <p>Raised beds are ideal for rooftops, courtyards, or small front yards. They allow you to control soil quality, manage weeds, and ensure proper drainage. With neatly arranged beds, you can grow vegetables, herbs, and flowers in organized rows—easy to maintain and harvest. Wooden or brick-edged beds can also enhance your garden’s aesthetic.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">4. Indoor Herb Gardens</h2>
    <p>Bring nature into your home by growing herbs like tulsi, mint, or rosemary on your kitchen windowsill or living room shelf. Use ceramic pots, tin cans, or glass jars to give your herb garden a personal touch. These mini gardens not only provide fresh seasoning at your fingertips but also add life and aroma to your interiors.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">5. Use Multipurpose Tools</h2>
    <p>Gardening in small spaces requires efficiency. Equip yourself with multipurpose tools—such as a combination trowel and weeder, or foldable stools with storage. These smart tools save space and make gardening easier, especially for beginners or those managing compact gardens. Choose durable, ergonomic tools to enjoy a stress-free gardening experience.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Top Tools Every Gardener Needs</h2>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
      <li><strong>Pruning Shears:</strong> Perfect for shaping plants, removing dead stems, and encouraging healthy regrowth. A sharp pair of shears makes precise cuts that help plants recover quickly and flourish.</li>
      <li><strong>Hand Trowel:</strong> This compact tool is essential for digging, transplanting, and breaking up soil. Ideal for use in containers and raised beds, a sturdy trowel speeds up your planting tasks significantly.</li>
      <li><strong>Watering Can/Spray:</strong> Ensure proper hydration by using a watering can with a long spout or a gentle mist spray for delicate seedlings. Consistent watering is crucial to help young plants establish roots and thrive.</li>
      <li><strong>Gardening Gloves:</strong> Keep your hands safe from thorns, rough soil, and insects. Choose gloves made from breathable, durable materials for maximum comfort and grip.</li>
      <li><strong>Weeder:</strong> A simple yet effective tool for uprooting weeds without disturbing your crops. Handy for keeping small garden beds clean and healthy.</li>
    </ul>

    intro:
      "Want to grow your own vegetables in the city? Here's a beginner’s guide to starting a home garden in urban areas like Kathmandu.",
    fullContent: `
    <section>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Step 1: Assess Your Space and Light</h2>
      <p>
        Identify the available space for your garden — balconies, rooftops, or small yards. Observe the sunlight patterns, as most vegetables require at least 5-6 hours of sunlight daily.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Step 2: Choose Suitable Containers and Soil</h2>
      <p>
        Use pots, raised beds, or recycled containers. Fill them with high-quality, nutrient-rich soil mixed with compost to ensure healthy plant growth.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Step 3: Select Easy-to-Grow Vegetables</h2>
      <p>
        Start with hardy, fast-growing vegetables like spinach, tomatoes, lettuce, and green chilies. These crops adapt well to container gardening and Kathmandu's climate.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Step 4: Watering and Maintenance</h2>
      <p>
        Water your plants regularly but avoid overwatering. Mulch to retain moisture and reduce weeds. Regularly check for pests and use organic methods for control.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Step 5: Harvesting and Enjoying Your Garden</h2>
      <p>
        Harvest vegetables when they reach maturity. Fresh homegrown produce tastes better and is free from harmful chemicals.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Starting a home garden in Kathmandu is a fulfilling way to connect with nature, improve your diet, and beautify your living space. GardenSewa can assist you with expert advice, design, and maintenance to make your urban garden flourish.

    fullContent: `
    <section>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Step 1. Utilize Wall Space</h2>
      <p>
       Install vertical garden panels or railing planters to add greenery without using floor space. Herbs, succulents, and air-purifying plants grow well in these compact setups.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">2. Choose Fast-Growing Plants</h2>
      <p>
        Opt for plants like spinach, mint, and radish that grow quickly and need less attention—perfect for apartment dwellers with limited time.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">3. Use Self-Watering Pots</h2>
      <p>
       These pots help maintain consistent moisture, reducing daily watering needs and preventing overwatering.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">4. Go for Indoor Plants</h2>
      <p>
      Snake plants, pothos, and peace lilies thrive indoors with minimal sunlight, adding fresh air and beauty to your home.
      </p>
      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Conclusion</h2>

       Urban gardening is about creativity and planning. With GardenSewa’s tools and support, your small space can bloom into a green oasis.

      "Gardening is evolving with creative, sustainable, and space-saving techniques. In 2025, Nepali gardeners are embracing new trends that bring beauty, efficiency, and eco-friendliness to homes and communities. Explore these popular practices supported by GardenSewa's innovative tools and products",
    fullContent: `
    <section>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Step 1: Edible Landscaping</h2>
      <p>
        Why separate beau  ty and utility? Edible landscaping blends ornamental and edible plants—like growing leafy greens, chili, or tomatoes alongside marigolds and herbs. It adds color and function to gardens while maximizing productivity in small spaces.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Step 2: Smart Watering Systems</h2>
      <p>
        With water conservation becoming a priority, drip irrigation, automatic timers, and moisture sensors are becoming popular. These systems ensure your plants get just the right amount of water—saving time, reducing waste, and promoting healthier growth.

      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Step 3: Container Composting</h2>
      <p>
        Urban gardeners are turning to compact compost bins and bokashi systems for managing organic waste. These odor-free solutions help convert kitchen scraps into nutrient-rich compost—perfect for pots, planters, or raised beds.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Step 4:  Native Plant Gardening</h2>
      <p>
        Using native species like marigold, tulsi, and jasmine supports local biodiversity and reduces maintenance. Native plants are more resistant to local pests and weather—making them ideal for low-effort gardening.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Step 5: Indoor Jungle Aesthetics </h2>
      <p>
        Creating lush green indoor spaces is trending, especially in apartments and studios. Hanging pothos, areca palms, and peace lilies in decorative planters can transform your living area into a tranquil oasis.
      </p>

        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Starting a home garden in Kathmandu is a fulfilling way to connect with nature, improve your diet, and beautify your living space. GardenSewa can assist you with expert advice, design, and maintenance to make your urban garden flourish.

              <ul class="list list-disc ps-4">
                <li>Determinate (Bush) Varieties: Compact, grow to a set size, and produce fruit in a shorter time. Examples include Roma and Patio varieties, perfect for pots.</li>
                <li>Mobility: Move plants to maximize sunlight or protect them during adverse weather.</li>
                <li>Cherry Tomatoes: Small fruit, compact plants, high yield. Varieties like ‘Sweet 100’ are ideal for container growing.</li>
                <li>Avoid indeterminate varieties for pots as they require heavy support and more space.</li>

    intro:
      "As urbanization increases in Nepal, many residents live in apartments or houses with limited outdoor space. However, a small balcony can become a lush, productive garden with the right ideas and care. Balcony gardening not only beautifies your home but also provides fresh vegetables, herbs, and flowers year-round. This guide from GardenSewa shares smart balcony gardening ideas tailored for Nepali homes—maximizing space, selecting suitable plants, and using vertical and container gardening techniques to transform your balcony into a green oasis.",

    <div class="first-paragraph ">
            <div class="point">
              <h5 class='my-5 font-bold text-[30px]'>1. Use Vertical Gardening to Maximize Space</h5>
              <p class='my-5'>Vertical gardening turns empty walls or railings into planting surfaces using trellises, hanging pots, and wall-mounted planters. Climbing plants like beans, cucumbers, and ivy gourds grow upward, saving precious floor space.

                Installing shelves or stackable planter boxes allows you to grow multiple plants in a compact area. Vertical gardens also add privacy and shade, improving your balcony’s comfort.

              </p>

              <h5 class='my-5 font-bold text-[30px]'> 2. Choose Suitable Containers and Planters</h5>
              <p class='my-5'>Lightweight pots made from plastic, fiber, or terracotta are ideal for balconies. Use containers with drainage holes to prevent waterlogging.Self-watering containers reduce maintenance by storing and releasing water slowly. Window boxes and railing-mounted planters help utilize railing spaces effectively.

              </p>

              <h5 class='my-5 font-bold text-[30px]'>3. Select Plants According to Light and Climate</h5>
              <p class='my-5'>Assess your balcony’s sunlight exposure and choose plants accordingly:
              </p>
              <div class="ul list">
                <li class=''>Full Sun: Tomatoes, chilies, basil, marigolds</li>
                <li class=''>Partial Shade: Spinach, lettuce, coriander, ferns.</li>
                <li class='pb-2'>Shade: Snake plant, peace lily, pothos.</li>
                <p>Herbs like mint, coriander, and lemongrass grow well in containers and add fresh flavors to Nepali dishes.</p>
              </div>

              <h5 class='my-5 font-bold text-[30px]'>4. Use Lightweight Potting Mix and Fertilizers</h5>
              <p class='my-5'>Heavy garden soil can strain balcony structures. Use lightweight, well-draining potting mixes blended with organic compost or coco peat. Fertilize regularly with organic liquid fertilizers or slow-release pellets to keep plants healthy without excess runoff.

              </p>

              <h5 class='my-5 font-bold text-[30px]'>5. Efficient Watering and Maintenance</h5>
              <p class='my-5'>Balconies dry out faster due to wind and sun exposure. Water plants early in the morning or late evening to minimize evaporation. Mulch container surfaces with dried leaves or straw to retain moisture. Regularly prune and deadhead plants to encourage growth and prevent overcrowding.

              </p>

              <h5 class='my-5 font-bold text-[30px]'>6. Add Decorative and Functional Elements</h5>
              <p>
                Incorporate decorative pots, colorful flowers, and garden ornaments to enhance aesthetics. Use small trellises or stakes to support climbing plants. Adding a small bench or stool creates a cozy corner where you can relax surrounded by greenery.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="conclusion">

              <p class='text-justify'>
                Balcony gardening in Nepal’s urban homes is a rewarding way to connect with nature, even in limited space.

              <ul class="list ps-4">
                <li class='list-disc py-2'>Have good drainage holes</li>

                <li class='list-disc py-2'>Are made of durable material (clay, plastic, recycled items)</li>
                <li class='list-disc py-2'>Match the plant’s root space needs</li>
              </ul>
              <p class='py-2'>For soil, a mix of garden soil + compost + cocopeat or sand works best. This combination retains moisture while maintaining drainage and nutrient supply.</p>

              <ul class="list ps-4">
                <li class='list-disc py-2'><b>Watering:</b> Most container plants need watering once a day during dry months. Early morning or evening is the best time.</li>

                <li class='list-disc py-2'><b>Sunlight:</b> Leafy greens need partial sunlight (3-4 hours/day), while flowering and fruiting plants require 6+ hours. Adjust container placement accordingly.</li>
